Evil on your mind,
Trouble at your feet,
Living by the gun,
The Devil's got you beat.
Evil on your mind,
Trouble at your feet,
Living by the gun,
Devil...
The Devil's got you beat.

Ya walk alone the course of sixty six.
Ya shoot the hand, e'ya took the flix.
Ya was want, ya was tall, ya was want...

Evil on your mind,
Trouble at your feet,
Living by the gun,
The Devil's got you beat.
Evil on your mind,
Trouble at your feet,
Living by the gun,
Devil...
The Devil's got you beat
